Disclaimer
----------

Please note that you need to observe the individual licenses of the software packages needed by the Xcoordination Application Space included in the distribution package!

Since the Xcoordination Application Space does not fully encapsulate all 3rd party libraries, you will access their APIs directly from your application code. This is intended by the Xcoordination Application Space as it is just a "thin" wrapper around those technologies.

However this entails you need to check the licenses of those packages and possibly explicitly license them yourself for use in your application. This in particular also pertains the:

-Microsoft Concurrency Coordination Runtime (CCR)
In order to use the CCR - either on its own or in conjunction with the
Xcoordination Application Space - you need to license it appropriately with regard to the software you are writing. Please see the CCR download and license conditions at http://www.microsoft.com/ccrdss/ or http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/robotics/default.aspx for any details.

The Xcoordination Application Space license expressly does not grant you any rights for using the CCR!



No Warranty
-----------

Xcoordination explicitly does not provide any warranty on software that you find in the Application Space package or that you download from this site.



What Does It Mean in Plain Words?
---------------------------------

Once you leave the evaluation phase of the Xcoordination Application Space check the licenses of Xcoordination Application Space, CCR and other 3rd party libraries if you need to pay royalties to Xcoordination, Microsoft or other companies for using their libraries.
