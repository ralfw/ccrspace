Issues
======

When constructing flows from sequential stages the processing is not sequential
	e.g. split line into words | count num of chars in word | check for even num | output result
	splitting is a scatter op, but the following stages are seq
	nonetheless the results for each word may come in arbitrary order	
	
	is sth wrong with the seq processing strategy?
	or is CCR Post() on a channel running on a separate thread?
	

===================
Done
===================
Simple listener
	-parallel or sequential processing
	-configuration thru ctor params or fluent interface

Ccrspace with default dispatcher and default dispQueue
	
Req/Resp

Exception handling

Pub/sub
	publishing is oneway msg processing (derive from oneway channel?)
	implement simplex ch. interface

Concat() for duplex channels
	accepts duplex or simplex channel as next stage
