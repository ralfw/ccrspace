Scatter/Gather (duplex)

Branches in flows
	use a custom channel/stage taking one input and several output channels
	
Timeout duplex channel (stage)

Logger channel to insert into flows

Multiplex channel (generic duplex)
	with interleave constraints

Switch channel (generic duplex)	
	
Flow tracing
	log a message on each stage transition
	
Config: Ccrspace with multiple dispatchers

Pub/sub: with filter

Named listeners and name resolution

Should the default for sequential processing be true?

======
Issues
======

When constructing flows from sequential stages the processing is not sequential
	e.g. split line into words | count num of chars in word | check for even num | output result
	splitting is a scatter op, but the following stages are seq
	nonetheless the results for each word may come in arbitrary order	
	
	is sth wrong with the seq processing strategy?
	or is CCR Post() on a channel running on a separate thread?
	
	***maybe the problem lies with the internal response handler
	used within flows? it´s defined as an Action without a sequentiality information.
	it would need to be created using the sequentiality info of the next stage.

Construction of channels from individual parameters is scattered throughout the code.
	Create a factory class with an interface
	Let the CcrSpace implement the factory class interface
	The factory can be primed with a dispatcher and a dpq
	

===================
Done
===================
Simple listener
	-parallel or sequential processing
	-configuration thru ctor params or fluent interface

Ccrspace with default dispatcher and default dispQueue
	
Req/Resp

Exception handling

Pub/sub
	publishing is oneway msg processing (derive from oneway channel?)
	implement simplex ch. interface

Concat() for duplex channels
	accepts duplex or simplex channel as next stage
	
Standalone CcrsCatch() with using()

Create flow from duplex channel
	.Do() (one way) -> CcrsFlowFluent
	.Do<TOutput>() (req resp)
