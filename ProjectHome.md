The CCR is a great tool to define asynchronous architectures. But sometimes its level of abstraction is too low, especially for developers using it only occaissonally.

The CCR Space is trying to raise the level of abstraction for asynchronous programming by building on top of the CCR.

In addition the CCR Space allows you to run any CCR code remotely with just two lines of code. So if you have a local CCR applicaton you can distribute it without much worrying. All communication and remoting of ports is handled transparently. This is a feat that the CCR Space accomplishes by building on top of the [Xcoordination Application Space](http://xcoappspace.codeplex.com/).
