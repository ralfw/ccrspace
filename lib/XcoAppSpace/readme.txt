Thanks for downloading the Xcoordination Application Space (AppSpace). We hope we can provide you with an exciting new experience of parallelizing and distributing your code.

License Information
-------------------
You find the full license text included in this package. At this point just let us state two things in a brief and pragmatic way:

-You´re allowed to use the AppSpace itself even in your closed source commercial projects without paying a fee to Xcoordination.

-You need to link the AppSpace at runtime to a couple of libraries which come with their own licenses. Whether or not you will need to pay a license fee to their manufacturers depends on how you´ll be using the AppSpace. Please see the readme.txt files in the respective folders in this ditribution for details.

Enjoy the AppSpace experience!
